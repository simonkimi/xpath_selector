# Parser
This library is for xpath selection only, you must define a parser, and here is my prebuilt parser:

xpath_selector_html_parser by html (html_example)

xpath_selector_xml_parser by xml (xml_example)

If you want to use another parser, refer to these two libraries to define your own parser that implements the XPathNode<T> interface
